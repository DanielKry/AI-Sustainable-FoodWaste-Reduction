Overview
This repository contains the MSc dissertation titled "Mitigating Household Food Waste Using AI for Sustainable Consumption", authored by Danylo Krywyj and submitted to Sheffield Hallam University in 2024. The dissertation, awarded a Distinction, explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models, to detect expiration dates on food packaging and address household food wasteâ€”a pressing environmental and economic challenge.

Key Contributions

Research Focus:

Utilizes AI to automate expiration date detection and reduce food waste.
Evaluates YOLO models under varied real-world conditions, including lighting, packaging types, and cluttered environments.
Dataset Utilisation:

Employs the ExpDate dataset, featuring annotated images of expiration dates captured in diverse scenarios, to train and evaluate object detection models.
Model Implementation and Results:

YOLOv5: Achieves precision > 0.9, mAP@0.5 = 0.95, and reliable detection in standard scenarios.
YOLOv8: Excels in complex conditions (low-light, distorted text), achieving precision of 0.94, recall of 0.91, and mAP@0.5 = 0.97.
Public Engagement:

Conducts a public survey to explore awareness of food waste and readiness to adopt AI-driven solutions.
Identifies barriers to adoption, including privacy and data security concerns.
Ethical Considerations:

Complies with GDPR and ethical research standards to ensure data privacy and transparency.
Project Deliverables

YOLO-Based Expiration Date Detection System:

A prototype capable of accurate expiration date detection in real-world conditions.
Comparative analysis of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 performance.
Survey Insights:

Analysis of public perceptions of AI applications in food waste management.
Key Findings

Performance Evaluation:

YOLOv8 outperforms YOLOv5, especially in challenging scenarios, demonstrating superior precision, recall, and robustness.
mAP metrics confirm both models' suitability for expiration date detection.
Impact Potential:

Automating expiration date tracking can significantly reduce food waste, encourage sustainable practices, and improve household food management.
Future Directions:

Expand the dataset to enhance model generalization.
Integrate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for improved text recognition.
Develop lightweight, user-friendly AI solutions for household use.
Usage and Adoption
This dissertation highlights the transformative potential of AI in addressing household food waste. It lays the groundwork for innovative solutions that balance technological advancement with user-centric design and ethical considerations for widespread adoption.
